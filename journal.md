Date - 1/25/26: Started Journal
    Today is the first day of logging in this journal. So far in the class we have learned about git/github, and have broken into our teams for the social media project. In the past, group projects have never been my favorite, but I think this one will be okay. My team seems very compotent (moreso than I in many ways), so we can hopefully build a great product. I have used github in the past, but never from the development side, so it is fascinating to learn how it works.

Date - 2/15/26: Making a flowchart
    Today I was tasked with making a flowchart that represented the login screen of our social media platform. I think I did a pretty good job for the most part, though I was a little unsure as to what level of secutiry we wanted to implement. I ended up going with what would look the best in the flowchart. I kinda feel like the underdog of the team, since I don't have nearly as much experience as the others. I am trying my best to keep up and not be a liability.

Date - 2/22/26: Presentation time
    This week we worked on prepping a slideshow for a presentation for the class. I tend to be good at public speaking, so I'm hoping that will carry over and let us have a great presentation. I'm pretty happy with where our slideshow is at right now after working on it all week. We've also been looking at starting to implement some our ideas for our project.
